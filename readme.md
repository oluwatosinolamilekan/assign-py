## Perfect Number Checker and Classification Scripts
  ### This repository contains Python scripts for various number-related tasks:
1. Perfect Number Checker (perfect_number.py):

Determines if a given number is a perfect number.
A perfect number is an integer whose sum of integer divisors (excluding the number itself) adds up to the number.

```bash
 python perfect_number.py
```

2. Number Classification (classify_numbers.py):

Classifies numbers in a given range as deficient, perfect, or abundant.
Provides results for numbers from 2 up to the user-specified upper limit.


```bash
 python classify_numbers.py
```

3. Hi-Low Number Guessing Game (hi_low_game.py):

A simple number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number.
Provides hints on whether the next guess should be higher or lower.
Game ends when the user correctly guesses the number or decides to quit.

```bash
 python hi_low_game.py
```

4. Hailstone Sequence Generator (hailstone_sequence.py):

Generates the hailstone sequence for a given initial number.
The hailstone sequence is formed by repeatedly applying a formula until the number reaches 1.


```bash
  python hailstone_sequence.py
```

## Instructions:
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Run the scripts individually by executing the respective Python files.
Follow the prompts and instructions provided by each script.
